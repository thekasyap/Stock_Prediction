This project implements a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model utilizes historical stock price data from Google's dataset and aims to forecast future stock prices for a chosen company. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series data, allowing the model to capture intricate patterns and trends in stock prices.

## Overview

The Stock Price Prediction project employs the following key components:

- Fetching historical stock price data using the Tiingo API.
- Preprocessing and scaling data to prepare it for input to the LSTM model.
- Creating an LSTM model architecture for stock price prediction.
- Training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance.
- Generating future stock price predictions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekasyap/Stock_Prediction.git
   cd Stock_Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn tensorflow pandas_datareader tiingo
   ```

3. Obtain a Tiingo API key:

   - Sign up for a Tiingo account: [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/)
   - Obtain your API key from your Tiingo account settings.

4. Update the Jupyter notebook with your Tiingo API key.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Stock_Prediction_Bharat_Intern.ipynb`.
2. Follow the notebook's step-by-step instructions to fetch data, preprocess it, create the LSTM model, train the model, and generate predictions.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.

The project provides insights into the prediction of stock prices using LSTM networks. Key results include:

- Visualizations of historical stock prices, training and test data, as well as predicted future prices.
- Evaluation metrics for the model's performance, such as mean squared error (MSE).

## Future Work

Here are some potential areas for future improvement:

- Experiment with different LSTM model architectures and hyperparameters.
- Incorporate additional features, such as trading volume or external factors, to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Explore ensemble methods or hybrid models for more accurate predictions.
